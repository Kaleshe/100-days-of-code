# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 06, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed knowledge on objects and multi-dimensional arrays in JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I find that it is harder for me to grasp things when they are too abstract. I need to practice using objects and arrays in real-life scenarios

### Day 2: February 07, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Implemented some of the JavaScript knowledge I have and created a pop-up inventory

**Thoughts:** Wish I spent a little more time on it... found it difficult to create a new node and place it on the dom so that might be what I'll work on tommorrow
