# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 06, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed knowledge on objects and multi-dimensional arrays in JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I find that it is harder for me to grasp things when they are too abstract. I need to practice using objects and arrays in real-life scenarios
